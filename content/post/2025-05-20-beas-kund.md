## Day Trek to Beas Kund!

In the middle of May of this year, I embarked upon a solo trek to Manali, a mountainous hamlet, north of Himachal Pradesh. I had thought of making this trek for a while but it was always delayed due to some frivoulous excuse. But this time the push came from an existential dread that seized India after the war began between India and Pakistan. Northern border states were shelled, drone strikes were spotted frequently at night and proximity to army command painted a target over Chandigarh for imminent air strike. Though the city took upon pretense of normalcy at daytime, blackouts and curfew were common at night and a sense of malaise gripped over the residents.
